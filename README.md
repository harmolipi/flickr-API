# Flight Booker
Created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.

View on [Github](https://github.com/harmolipi/flickr-api).

### Functionality

This is the [Flickr API](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/flickr-api) project, where I learn about using external APIs by building a very simple interface for letting a user enter a Flickr user id, and displaying all of that user's photos.

### Thoughts

This project was a good first experience with pulling data from an external API. I went through the steps of registering an app on the Flickr site, finding a [Flickr API gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/flickr), and figuring out how to properly pull data with it. It took some trial and error, but made a lot of sense once I figured it out, and all the information I needed was either in the gem's documentation or [Flickr's API documentation](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/).

God bless.
